# Images Folder

This folder should contain the following image assets:

## Required Images

1. **favicon.ico** - Website favicon (16x16, 32x32, or multi-size)

## Optional Images (Currently using Unsplash placeholders)

The website currently uses Unsplash placeholder images. You can replace these with your own:

- Hero background image (1920x1080 recommended)
- Service section images
- Team member photos (400x400 recommended, square format)
- Portfolio project images (800x600 recommended)
- About page images
- Services detail images

## Image Optimization Tips

- Use WebP format for better compression (with fallbacks)
- Optimize images before uploading (use tools like TinyPNG, ImageOptim)
- Maintain aspect ratios for consistent display
- Use descriptive filenames for SEO

## Current Image Sources

All images are currently sourced from Unsplash with construction/architecture themes. Replace these URLs in the HTML files with your own image paths once you have the assets ready.
